To use JD Icons in your project, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the icons directly.
2. Integrate the icons into your project. You can include them directly as image files or use them via CSS, as shown below.

### Using CSS

JD Icons are designed for effortless integration with CSS, similar to how Iconoir icons are used. Hereâ€™s how you can use them in your project:

1. **Import the CSS File**: Start by importing the `jd-icons.css` file into your project. 
2. **Apply the Icon Classes**: After importing the CSS, you can utilize the icons by applying the corresponding classes to your HTML elements.

The usage is similar to Iconoir, but with `jdicons-` as the class prefix. For example, to use the 'global_flex-direction_row' icon from JD Icons, you would write:

```html
<i class="jdicons-global_flex-direction_row"></i>
